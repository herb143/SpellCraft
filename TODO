TODO:
    -- Use an advanced spout plugin/something that can make custom items work nicer than raw Spout ******
    -- Add range enhancers
    -- Allow targeting of blocks? nahh or should we?
    -- Custom GUI for spellbook selection
    -- YOU BUILD THE SPELLS
    -- Spell idea: sniperfire. fires an arrow with 100% accuracy.

KNOWN BUGS:
    -- The scepters aren't supposed to stack (Category: Spout Limitations)
    -- When the scepter is dropped, a weird items.png graphic shows up (Category: Spout Limitations)
    -- The location of the HUD additions is sometimes weird (Category: Spout Limitations)
